then spending some time (~30 min) setting up the code
editor is definitely worthwhile.

This video includes some of the major features like
Package Control, Color Theme, Emmet, etc.
The guy who made this video is awesome, by the way.

Being able to write and execute snippets of code inside
of Sublime Text not only saves us from switching between
different windoes but also allows us to focus on the code
that we write. To do this with JavaScript, please refer
to this link:

In particular, if you're thinking about Method 2 with
node.js, replace the code in step 3 with the following
if you have set the path when installing node.js to
usr/local/bin/node

''' javascript
{
    "cmd": ["/usr/local/bin/node", "$file", "$file_base_name"],
    "working_dir": "${project_path:${folder}}",
    "selector": "*.js"
}
'''
